This is labeled data similar to that used in the 2009 PHM Society Data Challenge:

Gearbox
The data is representative of generic industrial gearbox data. Details of the apparatus used to collect the data are provided on the apparatus page.

Data
Data were sampled synchronously from accelerometers mounted on both the input and output shaft retaining plates. An attached tachometer generates 10 pulses per revolution providing very accurate zero crossing information.

Data were collected at 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 Hz shaft speed, under high and low loading. Additionally, different repeated runs are included in the data, although the run time and load were not sufficient to induce significant fault progression. There are a total of 560 samples to be classified.

Data are provided in .mat and .csv files, with three columns - the first column is input voltage, second is output voltage, and the third is tachometer.

Domain Fundamentals
Some fundamental signal processing techniques and diagnostic features for gearbox components are provided here. Additionally, code to assist in data analysis will be posted on the challenge blog
